# Minecraft Education with Python (MakeCode) - Moon Data Terraformer

This sub-folder is for a 3D model terraformer Python script for Miencraft Education.

Contained in this folder is a STL 3D printer model for the Copernicus crater on the Moon (see https://github.com/juedwards/MinecraftEducationPythonExamples/blob/main/terraform/Copernicuscrater3Xv.zip). Copernicus is a large young crater visible with binoculars slightly northwest of the center of the Moon's Earth-facing hemisphere. Copernicus is distinguished by its size and by the many bright rays pointing out from it. Although Copernicus is relatively young for a lunar crater, it was formed nearly a billion years ago by a colossal impact. The center of Copernicus is about 93 kilometers across. This model is rendered with a 3x vertical exaggeration.
